# HELIX
HELIX: A Novel Biological Image Storage System based on DNA Data Storage
## Requirements

## Quick Start
You can execute the test.py file. It will encode an example image as a set of nucleotide sequences, simulate generating a 2% error, and successfully recover it.
Example images can be downloaded from the reference website: https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abp9444
## Note
HELIX is still under review, we will update this document after acceptance and upload it to PyPI.
