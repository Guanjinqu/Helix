#HELIX: A Novel Biological Image Storage System based on DNA Data Storage
##Quick Start
You can execute the test.py file. It will encode an example image as a set of nucleotide sequences, simulate generating a 2% error, and successfully recover it.
##Note
HELIX is still under review, we will update this document after acceptance and upload it to PyPI.
